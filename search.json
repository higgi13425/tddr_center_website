    "text": "Gifts to the Translational Digestive Disease Center can help in three distinct ways:\n\nCo-sponsoring a funded project. Our 40 faculty members have over 100 grants funded by foundations and the NIH through national competitions. However, many funding agencies have to cut proposed funding by 10-20% for financial reasons. Co-sponsoring a funded project at 20% can make a research project that has already won a national competition for funding more likely to succeed.\nCo-funding pilot projects. These small grants of $50,000 are used to obtain important preliminary data to compete for larger national grants. Funding a pilot project often leads to larger future funding.\nEndowing the Translational Digestive Disease Research Center. An endowment is the most stable form of long-term funding for each of the research cores and the programs of the TDDR Center. You can provide core funds that will fund digestive disease research in perpetuity."
