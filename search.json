    "text": "Gifts to the Translational Digestive Disease Research Center can help advance digestive disease research in five distinct ways:\n\nCo-sponsoring a funded project. Our 40 faculty members have over 100 grants funded by foundations and the NIH through national competitions. However, many funding agencies have to cut proposed funding by 10-20% for financial reasons. Co-sponsoring a funded project at 20% can make a research project that has already won a national competition for funding more likely to succeed.\nCo-funding pilot projects. These small grants of $50,000 are used to obtain important preliminary data to compete for larger national grants. Funding a pilot project often leads to larger future funding.\nEndowing the Translational Digestive Disease Research Center. An endowment is the most stable form of long-term funding for each of the research cores and the programs of the TDDR Center. You can provide core funds that will fund digestive disease research in perpetuity.\nFunding Collaborative Seed Grants. These grants help launch new collaborations between our Center Researchers, providing $25K for each grant to fund an early partnership, the experiments to develop preliminary data, and the application for larger funding.\nFunding Bring Back a Technique Grants. These grants help fund travel to other centers to learn the latest techniques, and bring this knowledge back to teach our Center members. These grants provide $5K for each grant to fund travel and learning, to constantly keep our center on the cutting edge of science.\n\nTo find out more about gifts to the Translational Digestive Disease Research Center, contact:\n\nLori Hirshman\nDirector of Development, Departments, Centers and Institutes\n(734) 763-6080\nhirshmal@med.umich.edu"
