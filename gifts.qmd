Gifts to the Translational Digestive Disease Research Center can help advance digestive disease research in five distinct ways:

1.  [Co-sponsoring a funded project.]{.underline} Our 40 faculty members have over 100 grants funded by foundations and the NIH through national competitions. However, many funding agencies have to cut proposed funding by 10-20% for financial reasons. Co-sponsoring a funded project at 20% can make a research project that has already won a national competition for funding more likely to succeed.
2.  [Co-funding pilot projects.]{.underline} These small grants of \$50,000 are used to obtain important preliminary data to compete for larger national grants. Funding a pilot project often leads to larger future funding.
3.  [Endowing the Translational Digestive Disease Research Center.]{.underline} An endowment is the most stable form of long-term funding for each of the research cores and the programs of the TDDR Center. You can provide core funds that will fund digestive disease research in perpetuity.
4.  [Funding Collaborative Seed Grants.]{.underline} These grants help launch new collaborations between our Center Researchers, providing \$25K for each grant to fund an early partnership, the experiments to develop preliminary data, and the application for larger funding.
5.  [Funding Bring Back a Technique Grants.]{.underline} These grants help fund travel to other centers to learn the latest techniques, and bring this knowledge back to teach our Center members. These grants provide \$5K for each grant to fund travel and learning, to constantly keep our center on the cutting edge of science.
